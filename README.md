# OEECollectorAndWeb
A VB.NET OEE Collecting application that syncs to a Web2Py webserver written in Python. On the Web2py webserver a standard dashboard and configuration menu is available, including defining countries, plants, departments, machines, etc.

The OEE collecting can be done from an ET-7052 or a PET-7052 (PoE) Modbus module. An serial Expert Modbus module is also supported. There is even a small code for connecting to a custom ESP8266 Modbus server (see my other Github projects for the ESP8266 Modbus solution). 

This solution is still in beta, but due to other responsibilities I will not be able to actively contribute to this project. But it's also a small step away from being used in a production environment.

Please feel free to contact me for further details.
